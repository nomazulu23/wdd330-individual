Here is a potential list of tasks that could need to happen every time something changes in the project. This is a simplified list, but it should give you an idea of the complexity of the process. ðŸ˜°

Lint (review) CSS and JavaScript to find any coding issues.
Run unit tests to make sure nothing got broken with your last changes.
Compile all preprocessed CSS to CSS.
Concatenate all CSS into one file for faster loading.
Minify the CSS to reduce file size.
Transpile JavaScript with Babel for wider support for older browsers.
Concatenate all JS files into one file for faster loading.
Minify and Uglify JavaScript to reduce size.
Do the same for any 3rd party CSS or JS.
Move all the production assets into a distribution directory to separate them from the development stuff.
